# ASR_Notebook.

The Objective here is to develop a machine learning ASR model capable of accurately recognizing spoken words in Swahili.


# dataset.

I have 4 files.

test.csv - This is the dataset to which I will apply your model for testing

train.csv  - Train contains the target. This is the dataset that you will use to train your model.

test_audios.zip - Test audios you will use to test your model.

train_audios.zip - Train the audios you will use to train your model.


# progress

With the notebook given here in the table, I have built the pipeline. But when I finally trained the model, I got no predictions.
