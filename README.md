# ASR_Notebook.

The Objective here is to develop a machine learning ASR model capable of accurately recognizing spoken words in Swahili.


# Dataset.

I have 4 files.

- test.csv - This is the dataset to which I will apply your model for testing.

- train.csv  - Train contains the target. This is the dataset that you will use to train your model.

- test_audios.zip - Test audios you will use to test your model.

- train_audios.zip - Train the audios you will use to train your model.
